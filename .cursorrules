Ask any questions that you need to get information to take better decision.
Once I approve only then show the coding implementation.

Code Style Guidelines:

- Prioritize readability with concise implementation
- Use lambda functions for simple operations (one-liners)
- Avoid creating standalone functions unless they'll be called 3+ times
- Prefer inline code for operations used fewer than 3 times
- Maintain descriptive variable names despite brevity
